        PICT CSI Student Branch, working under CSI, was established in 2016 with an objective to facilitate research, knowledge and career enhancement for the students, along with inspiring and nurturing new entrants into the industry.

        <p className="text-white text-lg md:text-xl w-[20rem] md:w-[60rem]">
        It provides a platform for technical and non-technical education. One of our key strengths at PCSB is our rate of growth in a short span of time. We take pride in the fact that we are one of the best student communities in Pune, still growing at an exponential rate.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white text-lg md:text-xl w-[20rem] md:w-[60rem]">
          Being the largest student society in PICT, we have many technical and non-technical domains that interest students and help them to improve their skills. Students are encouraged to take part in the various activities taking place in the club and this helps in the overall development of the individuals.
